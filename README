COMPILING
=========

To compile Opulus you will need *Qt* >= 5.3, *CMake* >= 2.8.12 and compiler that supports C++14 (*GCC* >= 4.9 or *Clang* >= 3.4).
The coverage graph plugin uses the *dot (graphviz)*, so you also need it installed.

To compile just type:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
```
If you want to use another install prefix (the default is /usr/local) type:
```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/prefix ..
```
instead of `cmake ..`

On some distros (like Arch Linux) /usr/local/bin is not in the path, so is better to install on /usr, e.g:
```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
```

INSTALLING
==========

Just type as root
```
# make install
```
After that you must see the opulus icon under the K-menu on KDE or in another place on your favorite desktop env.


ABOUT WINDOWS
=============

This application compiles and runs on windows, you just need cmake and MinGW installed and the windows version of graphviz.
