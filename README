COMPILING
=========

To compile Opulus you will need Qt >= 4.3.1 and cmake >= 2.4.6.
The coverage graph plugin use the dot (graphviz), so you also need it installed.

To compile just type:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..

If you want to use another install prefix (the default is /usr/local) type:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/beautifull/prefix ..

instead of "cmake .."

On some distros (like Arch Linux) /usr/local/bin is not in the path, so is better to install on /usr, e.g:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..


INSTALLING
==========

Just type as root

# make install

After that you must see the opulus icon under the K-menu on KDE or in another place on your favorite desktop env.


ABOUT WINDOWS
=============

This application compiles and runs on windows, you just need cmake and MinGW installed and the windows version of graphviz.
